## About Me

My research interests lie in the explainability of AI agents through theoretical approaches, particularly within reinforcement learning algorithms. Aside from school, I really enjoying teaching and playing chess, basketball and ice hockey.

## Research Interests

- **LLMs:** Reinforcement Learning, Reasoning, Database vectorization, Signal Denoising, Computer Vision, Theory
- **Quantum Computing:** Simulation, Algorithms

<!-- ## Experiences 

**REU Intern at UMD**

I had the chance through an REU program to work full-time on quantum simulation research I started in the Spring of 2024 during the summer of 2024 as part of UMD's REU CARR program. This program allowed me to collaborate with other REU students working on various research projects, and I had the opportunity to present my own work. Over the summer, I focused on extending my simulation of k-local Hamiltonians to include fermionic operators, building on the previous work with Pauli operators. I found this experience particularly rewarding because it gave me the chance to work on a project full-time, free from the usual pressures of coursework. It also gave me a clearer insight into what life as a graduate student is really like, and helped me reassure myself that a PhD is something I really wanted to do after I obtained my masters degree. 

**ITS Intern at AARP**

Implemented multiple chat bots, including a local, finetuned model to company data.

**Teaching Assistant (Discrete Mathematics)**

Expanding on my past teaching experience, being a TA for an actual university class taught me how to teach class in a fast but understandable manner to students. As a TA, I led a discussion section, graded student work, and held office hours. I was grateful that I was able to lead my own discussion section because it gave me more freedom to teach in a matter that would help the students understand the material in a conceptual manner and help answer the question "Why?" to course material instead of just looking at the "How?". In addition, I also had the opportunity to grade work that reflected the things that I taught in a setting where my teaching mattered more. This grading gave me feedback to areas in the coursework where students had more confusion in. These areas of confusion allowed me to figure out what to emphasize during my discussion sections and office hours.

I really enjoyed my TA experience and I wish to do more in the form to teaching later on. Teaching college courses suits me as well since in college, courses get to a point where they are actually interesting and the importance of actually understanding the "Why?" becomes more important instead of just learning the "How?". I would definitely be interested in teaching more college-level courses in the area of computer science or mathematics. 

**Kumon Math and Reading Center of Clarksville**

At this job, I taught a lot of students of differing ages, from toddlers to students in high school. Predominantly, I taught high-level math, which included topics from Algebra II, Precalculus, Calculus I and Calculus II. I really enjoyed this job because it allowed me to interact with the same students and watch each student grow.  -->
