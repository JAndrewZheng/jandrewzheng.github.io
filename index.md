## About Me

I am a Senior at University of Maryland, College Park, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in learning more about Computer Vision, Natural Language Process, Diffusion Models, and Quantum Computing. Although I have minimal in-depth research experience, I would enjoy doing a research project in a large amount of topics to see what interests me. Aside from school, I really enjoying teaching and playing chess, basketball and ice hockey.

## Research Interests

- **Quantum Computing:** Cryptography, Quantum Algorithm speedups
- **Computer Vision:** 3-D Imaging, Neural Networks, Modeling
- **Natural Language Processing:** Database Embeddings, Diffusion Models, Adversarial Attacks, Model Memorization

## Projects 

**Fantasy Basketball Project**

<ul>
<li> Created a <a href="https://andrewzayn.github.io/">tutorial</a> which teaches how to calculate Fantasy Points from NBA player stats from the 2021-2022 season and conduct data analysis on those calculated fantasy point values </li>
</ul>

**(NASA Goddard Internship) Binning Techniques for Solar Wind and Geomagnetic Data**

<ul> 
<li>Created <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kQjVQ5YEQRJgyfJcXdeBf3LZXl0UATRK">3 posters</a> representing my work throughout this two-year research project. </li>

<li>Presented a poster during the AGU conference held on December 12th, 2018 in Washington, D.C. titled
<a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/396419">"SM31D-3525 Effects of Data Binning Techniques on Results of Analyzing Solar Wind and Geomagnetic Indices Data”</a></li>
</ul>

## Experiences 

**Teaching Assistant (CMSC250)**

<ul>
Expanding on my past teaching experience, being a TA for an actual university class taught me how to teach class in a fast but understandable manner to students. In addition, I also had the opportunity to grade work that reflected the things that I taught in a setting where my teaching mattered more. 

**Kumon Math and Reading Center of Clarksville**

At this job, I taught a lot of students of differing ages, from toddlers to students in high school. Predominantly, I taught high-level math, which included topics from Algebra II, Precalculus, Calculus I and Calculus II. I really enjoyed this job because it allowed me to interact with the same students and watch each student grow. 

**(Internship) NASA Goddard Space Flight Center**

At this internship, I worked with a large dataset containing solar wind and magnetosphere data. Throughout this internship, I learned a lot about the physics behind the relationship between the Earth's Magnetosphere and solar wind and how to conduct data analysis on large data. However, I felt like I gained the most on the thought process behind doing research. In the end, I really enjoyed this experience because I was given autonomy to do research on areas that related to the project and accept or reject ideas based on the unique circumstances of my project.

## Hobbies

**Chess:** Ever since I was around 5.5 years old, I've been playing chess competitively. Over time, I became really good at board game, winning state championships and playing at invitational events. Here are some of my achievements: 

- Scholastic Maryland State Champion for years 2014 – 2017, 2020
- Maryland Sweet 16 Champion in the 5th Grade, achieving full scholarship to University of Maryland, Baltimore County
- Achieved National Master Title at age 12

**Ice Hockey:** I started playing ice hockey when I was around 7 years old. In my ice hockey career, I played in both high school leagues and club ice hockey leagues playing with other future D1 players. Here are some of my achievements in ice hockey: 

- Howard County All-Star 2016-2020
- 2x Maryland Student Hockey League Second Team All-State
- Last Ice Hockey Team: Washington Little Caps AAA U18

**Basketball:** I'm a bit too short to play basketball well competitively but it has always been a fun sport for me to play. Whenever I have free time, I usually spend it playing pickup basketball. Recently, basketball has become one of my favorite hobbies because it's a way to connect with friends and engage in an activity that is beneficial for everybody.
